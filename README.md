# StackOverflow Clone Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a clone of StackOverflow using SvelteKit for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. Users will be able to ask, answer, and vote on questions, among other features.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: SvelteKit
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Functions)

## Features

- User authentication (Sign up, Login, Logout)
- Post questions
- Post answers
- Upvote and Downvote questions and answers
- Comment on questions and answers
- Search and Filter questions
- Tags to categorize questions
- User profiles
- Admin dashboard

## Database Schema (Firebase Firestore)

### Users Collection

- uid
- username
- email
- profilePicURL
- reputation

### Questions Collection

- questionId
- title
- body
- tags
- votes
- createdAt
- createdBy

### Answers Collection

- answerId
- body
- votes
- createdAt
- createdBy

### Comments Collection

- commentId
- body
- createdAt
- createdBy

### Tags Collection

- tagId
- tagName

## Frontend (SvelteKit)

- Setup SvelteKit project
- Create pages (Home, Question, Login, Signup, Profile, Admin)
- Implement routing
- Create reusable components (Header, Footer, QuestionCard, AnswerCard)
- Implement state management (use Svelte stores)
- Connect to Firebase SDK
- Style the application (consider using Tailwind CSS)

## Backend (Firebase)

- Setup Firebase project
- Configure Firebase Authentication
- Setup Firestore database and define security rules
- Implement Firebase Functions for server-side logic (e.g., updating user reputation, handling votes)

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit and integration tests (consider using Jest or a similar testing framework)
- Setup continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Perform manual testing
- Optimize performance (e.g., use Firebase indexes, optimize image loading)

## Deployment

- Choose a hosting platform (consider using Firebase Hosting or Vercel)
- Deploy the frontend and backend
- Setup custom domain (if necessary)
- Monitor and analyze application performance and errors

## Maintenance and Monitoring

- Setup monitoring tools (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Google Analytics)
- Keep dependencies up-to-date
- Fix bugs and improve performance based on user feedback and monitoring data
- Implement new features as necessary

## Documentation and Training

- Document the codebase
- Create a developer guide and end-user guide
- Train the admin/users (if necessary)
